# Landing Page Project
Manipulating the DOM project in udacity course: web development professional track

## features of the project
* multi-sections page
* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list
* Styling has been added for active states
* Sections are collapsible

## notes
I have tryed linking app.js file by putting script tag in:
1. the bottom of the body element
2. the head element and using DOMContentLoaded event
* By using performance.now()
  I found that the second choice takes less time to load.
